# Digital Typhoon Dataset

## Overview

This page summarize information about the official release of the Digital Typhoon dataset, the longest typhoon satellite image dataset for 40+ years aimed at benchmarking machine learning models for long-term spatio-temporal data. To build the dataset, we developed a workflow to create an infrared typhoon-centered image for cropping using Lambert azimuthal equal-area projection referring to the best track data. We also address data quality issues such as inter-satellite calibration to create a homogeneous dataset. To take advantage of the dataset, we organized machine learning tasks by the types and targets of inference, with other tasks for meteorological analysis, societal impact, and climate change.

## Dataset

The dataset is available at [Digital Typhoon Dataset](http://agora.ex.nii.ac.jp/digital-typhoon/dataset/).

## Software

We released machine learning library for the Digital Typhoon Dataset at [pyphoon2](https://github.com/kitamoto-lab/pyphoon2).
