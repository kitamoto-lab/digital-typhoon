# Digital Typhoon Dataset

## Overview

This page summarizes the official release of the Digital Typhoon dataset, the longest typhoon satellite image dataset for 40+ years, aimed at benchmarking machine learning models for long-term spatio-temporal data. To build the dataset, we developed a workflow to create an infrared typhoon-centered image for cropping using Lambert azimuthal equal-area projection referring to the best track data. We also address data quality issues such as inter-satellite calibration to create a homogeneous dataset. To take advantage of the dataset, we organized machine learning tasks by the types and targets of inference, with other tasks for meteorological analysis, societal impact, and climate change.

## Dataset

[Digital Typhoon Dataset](http://agora.ex.nii.ac.jp/digital-typhoon/dataset/) is a satellite image dataset designed for machine learning research on tropical cyclones. The dataset comprises a total of 1,099 typhoons and 189,364 infrared images from the western Pacific basin.

## Software

[pyphoon2](https://github.com/kitamoto-lab/pyphoon2) is a machine learning library for the Digital Typhoon Dataset. 

## Website

[Digital Typhoon](http://agora.ex.nii.ac.jp/digital-typhoon/) is one of Japan's most popular and largest typhoon information websites. The annual page view is around 20 million, and many people visit the website to check the latest information and study historical data.
